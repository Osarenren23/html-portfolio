  I have a first Class Honour from both university and Law School. One of my dreams, is to study at Havard on full scholarship for my Masters Program.
  I am currently learning how to create a website because of the idea that i have. I planned to get a web developer who will create my website, 
  however, it would be expensive and hard to find a web developer who believes in you. 
  so i decided to be the web developer that my idea needs. Regardless of what happens, i will have added to new skill to myself and adding more value for me. 
  It is the ideal win-win situation. I am not expecting this journey to be easy, but it is a journey i am willing to take.
